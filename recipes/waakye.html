        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Waakye is a popular Ghanaian dish made of rice and beans cooked with
            millet leaves (waakye leaves) for added color and flavor
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Black-eyed peas or Red Cowpeas</li>
            <li>Waakye Leaves</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the beans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>
                In a large pot, add the beans, waakye leaves, and enough water
                to cover the beans by about an inch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about
                30&#x002D;40 minutes, or until the beans are tender but not
                mushy.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're using baking soda instead of waakye leaves, add it at
                this point to enhance the color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse the rice until the water runs clear, then add it to the
                pot with the beans.
            </li>
            <li>Add salt to taste and mix gently.</li>
            <li>
                Add more water if necessary, so the rice and beans are covered
                by about an inch of water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the pot and let it cook on medium heat for 15&#x002D;20
                minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the water.
                Stir occasionally to prevent burning, but avoid over-stirring as
                it can make the rice mushy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the rice is tender and water is absorbed, remove from heat
                and let it sit covered for 5&#x002D;10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the waakye leaves before serving.</li>
            <li>
                Serve waakye hot with your favorite sides, such as fried
                plantains, boiled eggs, spaghetti, fish, or a Ghanaian tomato
                stew.
            </li>
        </ol>
