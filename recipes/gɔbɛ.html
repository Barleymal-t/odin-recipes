        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Black-eyed peas or Red Cowpeas</li>
            <li>Palm oil</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Pepper (scotch bonnet or chili)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Gari</li>
            <li>Ripe plantains</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Boiled eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the beans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, add the beans and enough water to cover them by about an inch.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30&#x002D;40 minutes, or until the beans are tender. Add salt to taste in the last 5 minutes of cooking.</li>
            <li>Drain the water and set the beans aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat the palm oil over medium heat. Be careful not to overheat as it can burn quickly.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and pepper, and cook until the tomatoes break down, forming a thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked beans to the palm oil sauce and stir to combine, allowing the beans to absorb the flavors of the sauce. Cook for a few more minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Place the bean mixture on a plate and sprinkle a generous amount of gari over the beans.</li>
            <li>Serve with fried ripe plantains, sliced avocado, and boiled eggs if desired.</li>
          </ol>
